# DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction

## Real-Time Hand-Tracking Interaction with GPU-Based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Fluid in Virtual Reality

This project explores the interaction of real-time hand tracking with GPU-based Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) fluid simulation in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Using the SPH particle method, we simulated dynamic fluid behaviors such as splashing and merging, enhancing the realism and interactivity of virtual fluids. 

Our implementation uses Unity and the Meta XR All-in-One SDK for VR development, ensuring efficient simulation and rendering through GPU compute shaders. On Meta Quest 3, users can naturally interact with virtual fluids via hand-tracking. Although high frame rates were only achieved with up to 50,000 particles, future work will focus on improving model efficiency and enhancing interaction realism by introducing tangential forces and surface tension.
